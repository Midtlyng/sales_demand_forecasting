## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as a personal learning exercise. An AI assistant (Google's Gemini) was used as a tutor to provide guidance on code formatting, explain technical terminology, and help structure the project workflow according to industry best practices. The core logic, analysis, and interpretation of the results are my own.
